This is a survey for people who run public instances of Mastodon and 
other decentralized social software. Its goal is to allow prospective
users (and current users) to make informed decisions about
whether they want to use your instance.  The survey and every question
on it is entirely optional.  If you're confident a question won't matter
to the people you want as users, then feel free to skip it.

To answer this survey:
1. Make a copy of this survey somewhere on the web.  One option is to just
   fork this repo.
2. Edit the document, filling in your answers.  Do not edit the headings.
3. If there are other questions you think should be on this survey, feel
   free to add them, with your to your response, using the same format.
4. Using your admin account, reply to this post https://coming-some
5. In your reply, include a link to your filled out survey and use the 
   hashtag #adminsurvey

That's it!   The goal of this procedure is to remain highly decentralized,
allowing anyone to gather up these responses and create pretty charts and 
useful guides.

This is a living document.  Some questions may be added, and some may be 
deprecated or removed.  Feel free to create new github issues on this
repo to discuss aspects of the survey and propose changes.

You may want to revisit your survey answers occasionally,
in case important new questions have been added or your answers have 
changed.

This survey started at https://github.com/sandhawke/admin-survey

This document is intended to be parsed as markdown, or the resulting
html, with the questions starting with '###' (html h3) and the answer 
being the text after the question and before the next question.  The
text of the questions is intended to be matched exactly; if you change
the question at all, systems gathering results will think its a new
question.
