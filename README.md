**Don't do this yet.  Still being drafted.**

This is a survey for people who run public instances of Mastodon and 
other decentralized social software. Its goal is to allow prospective
users (and current users) to make informed decisions about
whether they want to use your instance.  The survey and every question
on it is entirely optional.  If you're confident a question won't matter
to the people you want as users, then feel free to skip it.  If your
users are all friends of yours, this probably wont be useful.

To answer this survey:
1. Make a copy of this survey somewhere on the web.  One option is to just
   fork this repo.
2. Edit the document, filling in your answers.  Do not edit the headings.
3. If there are other questions you think should be on this survey, feel
   free to add them (along with your response) using the same format.
4. Using your admin account, reply to this post https://coming-soon-tbd
5. In your reply, include a link to your filled out survey and use the 
   hashtag #adminsurvey

That's it!   The goal of this procedure is to remain highly decentralized,
allowing anyone to gather up these responses and create pretty charts and 
useful guides.

This is a living document.  Some questions may be added, and some may be 
deprecated or removed.  Feel free to create new github issues on this
repo to discuss aspects of the survey and propose changes.

You may want to revisit your survey answers occasionally,
in case important new questions have been added or your answers have 
changed.

This document is intended to be parsed as markdown with the questions/topics 
prefixed with ### and the answers being all the text until
the next ### or end of document. The heading text is intended to be matched 
exactly; if you change the question at all, systems gathering results will 
think its a new question.

### Domain name

example.org (remove this line and put your own instance domain name here)

### What inspired you to create this instance?

### Creation date (yyyy-mm-dd)

### Where is the money coming from to operate this instance?

(Like, are you donating it, and it's no big deal?  Are you asking for donations?  Do you
plan to make it a freemium business, with some pay-for-service accounts?  Do you plan to
mine user data and sell it, or show ads?)

### Who would you like to see as users?

### Do you promise to giving your users at least 7 days notice before shutting down?

### Do you promise to giving your users at least 90 days notice before shutting down?

### Contingency plans

(Uncomfortable question, but what happens if you are unable to function as admin?  Perhaps
you get very sick, or there's a natural disaster that brings down the internet for weeks in
your part of the world.  Sometimes asked as "What if you get hit by a bus".  If you haven't
figured this out, say "None" or leave blank.)

### Profile URLs for others who share admin responsibility (say "none" if it's just you)

### Will someone respond to fix site problems 24x7x365? If not, when will site issues be addressed?

(Be honest.  Maybe the answer is "it might take a few days".)

### What relevant experience do you and/or your team have as system administrators?

### What relevant experience do you and/or your team have as moderators?

### What kind of content goes beyond "free speech" and will get removed if reported?

### Philosophy about which software versions/forks/plugins the site runs

(Do you install release candidates?   How quickly do you install official releases?  Do you 
have local modifications?  How much you decide which plugs to install, if they start to be 
common?   Any thoughts on what you'll do if there's ever a fork in the main software you
use?)

### Domain name of hosting company or colocation data center

### Number of servers?

(Probably 1 for small sites.  This may be useful to developers and other admins, as well as users)

### Number of cores in total?

### GB RAM in total?

### GB persistent storage currently in use?

### Monthly hosting cost (including units like USD or EUR)

### URL for an icon or image for your instance

(only if you have one, of course.  it's fine to leave these blank.   but maybe you can find a
picture captures the spririt of your instance.)

### URL of a recent photo of you 

### URL of a video of you discussing your answers to this survey

(again, this kind of thing is totally optional.  but it could be fun!)

### Your legal name

### What you prefer to be called in this context

### Your mailing address

(some people will feel better knowing they can contact you off-line if necessary)
